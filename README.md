Currently I'm working on [CinemaCentral](https://github.com/potatodiet/CinemaCentral), a self-hostable home media streaming website.
Feel free to try it out and see if you like it better than Jellyfin and Plex. I'm not actively looking for contributors right now.

### Useful Projects

- [homebrew-tweego](https://github.com/potatodiet/homebrew-tweego) if you write Twine stories with a Mac.
- [diceware-gen](https://github.com/potatodiet/diceware-gen) if you want to privately generate random word sequences, especially if you're an Arch Linux user since it's on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/diceware-gen).
- [mood](https://github.com/potatodiet/mood) if you want to see how your music-derived mood stacks up against the average person.
- [uoft-tools](https://github.com/potatodiet/uoft-tools) helped me decide which courses to take while studying computer science at the University of Toronto.
